# Cryptocurrency Live data visualization in Tableau by Google sheet / App script
Visualization of live (regularly updated) Cryptocurrency data in Tableau

## Overview
- Visualised live cryptocurrency trade data (Bitcoin, XRP, Ethereum) in Tableau using API by [Independent Reserve](https://www.independentreserve.com/). The data gets renewed by an hour and shows the data of recent 10 days.
- Used Google sheets as a storage of the live trade data. This was achieved by Google app script and I imported the Google sheets to Tableau.
